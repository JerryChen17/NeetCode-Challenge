Find repeated object as iterating through the list

The key to use hashing is to find a proper “key” and “value” so as the given array is being iterated through, it would save the value and find the key to complete the task successfully.

use hash to store value and use “if keys in dict” to check existing keys.

Anagram (learn how to use proper value in hashmap)
in hash map the key is the character and value is the number of time it appeared

Two Sum (learn how to use proper key and value in hashmap)
In a hash map, the key is the number and the value is the index of that number.
“diff = target - n “ is very important in this practice.
for example:
	nums = [1, 4, 3] 
hashMap = {1:0, 4:1, 3:2}
